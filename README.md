# tumor_cancer_prediction
A tumor is an abnormal lump or growth of cells. When the cells in the tumor  are normal, it is benign. Something just went wrong, and they overgrew and  produced a lump. When the cells are abnormal and can grow  uncontrollably, they are cancerous cells, and the tumor is malignant. The early diagnosis of Tumor can improve the prognosis and chance of  survival significantly, as it can promote timely clinical treatment to patients.  Further accurate classification of benign tumors can prevent patients  undergoing unnecessary treatments.  The goal of the Project is to: â–ª Predict the Patient diagnosis based on the given features.
